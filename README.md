## Tools Description

### Nmap

[Nmap](https://nmap.org) (Network Mapper) is a powerful open-source tool used for network discovery and security auditing. It is widely utilized by network administrators and security professionals for:

- **Host Discovery**: Identifying live hosts on a network.
- **Port Scanning**: Enumerating open ports and services.
- **Service and Version Detection**: Determining running services and their versions.
- **OS Detection**: Identifying the operating system and hardware characteristics.
- **Scriptable Interaction**: Using the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) for advanced scanning capabilities.

**Key Features**:

- Flexible and powerful command-line interface.
- Supports various scanning techniques (TCP, UDP, SYN, ACK, etc.).
- Generates detailed reports and supports output in multiple formats (XML, grepable, etc.).
- Extensive community support and regularly updated with new features.
