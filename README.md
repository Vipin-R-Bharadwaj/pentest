# Endpoint Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview

This Python application automates vulnerability scanning for specified endpoints by integrating multiple renowned security tools. Currently, it supports Nmap, Nikto, OWASP ZAP, and WhatWeb, with Metasploit integration in progress. It allows users to perform comprehensive security assessments using command-line arguments to specify the tools and endpoints.

## Features

- **Nmap**: Network exploration and security auditing.
- **Nikto**: Web server scanner for detecting dangerous files, outdated server software, and configuration issues.
- **OWASP ZAP**: Open-source web application security scanner.
- **WhatWeb**: Website fingerprinting tool to identify technologies used by websites.
- **Metasploit** (Coming Soon): Framework for developing and executing exploit code against remote targets.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.9**
- **Installed Tools**: Ensure that [Nmap](https://nmap.org/download.html), [Nikto](https://cirt.net/Nikto2), [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/), and [WhatWeb](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb) are installed and accessible via the command line.

## Usage

Run the application using command-line arguments to specify the endpoints file and the tools to use.

### Command-Line Arguments

```bash
python server.py -f endpoints.txt [options]
```

#### Options

- `-f`, `--file`: Path to the file containing endpoints.
- `-a`, `--all`: Use all available tools for scanning.
- `--nmap`: Use Nmap for scanning.
- `--nikto`: Use Nikto for scanning.
- `--whatweb`: Use WhatWeb for scanning.
- `--zaproxy`: Use OWASP ZAP for scanning.

### Examples

- **Scan with Nmap**

  ```bash
  python server.py -f endpoints.txt --nmap true
  ```

- **Scan with Nikto and WhatWeb**

  ```bash
  python server.py -f endpoints.txt --nikto true --whatweb true
  ```

- **Scan with All Tools**

  ```bash
  python server.py -f endpoints.txt --all true
  ```

## Tools Description

### Nmap

[Nmap](https://nmap.org) (Network Mapper) is a free and open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing. It is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses. **Documentation**: [Nmap Docs](https://nmap.org/docs.html)

### Nikto

[Nikto](https://cirt.net/Nikto2) is an open-source web server scanner that performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6,700 potentially dangerous files/CGIs, checks for outdated versions, and version-specific problems. **Documentation**: [Nikto Docs](https://cirt.net/Nikto2)

### OWASP ZAP

[OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org) (Zed Attack Proxy) is an open-source web application security scanner. It is designed to be used by both those new to application security as well as professional penetration testers.  **Documentation**: [ZAP Docs](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/)

### WhatWeb

[WhatWeb](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb) identifies websites by creating a fingerprint of the technologies they use. It can detect content management systems, blogging platforms, statistic/analytic packages, JavaScript libraries, and more. **Documentation**: [WhatWeb Docs](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb)

### Metasploit (In Progress)

[Metasploit Framework](https://www.metasploit.com) is a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine. It is a powerful platform used for penetration testing and security research. **Documentation**: [Metasploit Docs](https://docs.metasploit.com)
